Title: My Generated Informative Text
## Description
On the deployment website, there is a generated text box showing a passage about fruit production and exportation in a country. As the user clicks the "reroll it" button, a new passage with a different greeting message, name, country, fruit, unit, amount and percentage will be shown. The passage generation contains three ways of expansion: replacing a single word with one of the same type, replacing a single word with multiple ones of the same type, replacing a single word with a combination of the original type and a different type.
## Artistic Statement
On the website, a black website background is used to distinguish the background from the text box and create a context of old fashioned text display. A light green background is applied to the text box surrounded with white shadow, which gives the text box more depth. The button has a white background which is used to distinguish the clickable button from the website background and the text box.
