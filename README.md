Title: My Generated Informative Text
## Description
On the deployment website, there is a generated text box showing a passage about fruit production and exportation in a country. As the user clicks the "reroll it" button, a new passage with a different greeting message, name, country, fruit, unit, amount and percentage will be shown. 
## Artistic Statement
I tried to add a new way of expansion for this assignment. With two ways of expansion from the starter, I added in a new one - replacing a single word with a combination of the original type and a different type: (amount --> amount(E.g. two) scale(E.g. billion)).
